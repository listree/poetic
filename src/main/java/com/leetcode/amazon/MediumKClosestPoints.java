 * 973. K Closest Points to Origin (Medium)
 * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
 * return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
 * Runtime: 71 ms, faster than 24.43% of Java online submissions for K Closest Points to Origin.
 * Memory: 113.9 MB, less than 71.42% of Java online submissions for K Closest Points to Origin.
